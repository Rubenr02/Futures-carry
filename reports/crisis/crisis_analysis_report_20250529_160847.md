## Key Observations
1. **Tail Risk Management**: The Ensemble strategy consistently demonstrated superior tail risk management across all crisis periods, with higher VaR and CVaR values compared to S&P 500.
2. **Crisis Resilience**: During the 2020 COVID crisis, the Ensemble strategy showed significantly lower drawdown compared to equities (-18% vs -34% for S&P 500).
3. **Inflation Hedge**: In the 2022 inflationary environment, the Ensemble strategy delivered positive returns while both benchmarks suffered significant losses.
4. **Consistent Outperformance**: The strategy outperformed both benchmarks in all crisis periods on a total return basis, particularly during prolonged stress like the 2022 inflation shock.

## Strategic Implications
- The diversified, volatility-targeted approach provides effective crisis protection
- Carry factors demonstrate resilience during monetary policy shocks
- Dynamic leverage adjustment during equity stress periods enhances returns
- The strategy provides valuable portfolio diversification during equity market crises
